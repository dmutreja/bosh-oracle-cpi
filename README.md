# BOSH Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CPI

# EXPERIMENTAL

This is an external [BOSH CPI](http://bosh.io/docs/bosh-components.html#cpi) for [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://cloud.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure)

## Usage

### Installation
The CPI implementation contained in this repository is deployed as part of  [BOSH Oracle CPI release](https://github.com/oracle/bosh-oracle-cpi-release). 

### Development

The source for this CPI is not intended to be deployed except as a BOSH deployment. 
To build or install the CPI locally for development or test purposes, you can symlink the repository into your Go workspace.

From the root of the [BOSH Oracle CPI release](https://github.com/oracle/bosh-oracle-cpi-release) repository:

```
mkdir -p  $GOPATH/src/github.com/oracle
ln -s $(pwd)/src/github.com/oracle/bosh-oracle-cpi $GOPATH/src/github.com/oracle/bosh-oracle-cpi
```

### Building the CPI locally

From $GOPATH/src/github.com/oracle/bosh-oracle-cpi

```
make build
```
Builds the cpi executable as $GOPATH/src/github.com/oracle/bosh-oracle-cpi/out/cpi

#### Running development tests

$GOPATH/src/github.com/oracle/bosh-oracle-cpi/Makefile has targets to run two kinds of development tests

1. Unit tests 

    * ``make test``

        Runs all unit tests. Unit tests use fakes and don't interact with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
    
    * ``TEST_SPEC=CreateDisk make single-test``
    
        Runs a single unit test specified in the TEST_SPEC variable, CreateDisk spec in this example
    
2. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tests

    * ``make ocitest``

    Runs tests in oci/test package. The tests in this package drive the layer responsible for bulk of the work in the CPI. E.g. creating/deleting  a vm instance  or a persistent block volume.
    
    Configuration values required for running this target are specified in the format used by various [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure SDKs](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm).

    The default configuration file name and location is ~/.oci/config.  The configuration file can contain multiple profiles. Tests run by this target
    use the [CPITEST] profile by default.

    The default file location and the profile name can be changed by
    setting the CPITEST_CONFIG and CPITEST_PROFILE environment variables respectively.

    List of configuration entries 

    | Entry         | Description
    | ------------- |-------------
    | tenancy       | OCID of the tenancy in which CPI will create(or delete) the requested resources
    | user          | OCID of the user in that tenancy 
    | region        | Region to use
    | key_file      | API key file used to sign the requests 
    | fingerprint   | Fingerprint of the API key uploaded to OCI
    | compartment   | OCID of the compartment in which the resources will be created
    | ad            | Name of the Avaialibilty Domain in the region
    | vcn           | Name of the VCN to use
    | subnet        | Name of the subnet in that VCN to use
    | cpiUser       | Name of the provisioned user in the image. Used by CPI ssh to attach iscsi block volumes
    | cpiPrivateKeyPath | Path to locally provisioned ssh private key
    | cpiPublicKeyPath | Path to locally provisioned ssh public key
    | userPublicKeyPath | (Optional) Public key to install when creating a new instance
    | stemcellImage | OCID of the stemcell image for creating new instances

     * ``make ocitest-subset``
    can be used to run a subset of oci tests. 
    
    For example,
     * ``TEST_SPEC=Test_VmOps make ocitest-subset``
     
     runs tests containing the expression Test_VmOps in their name
     
     Note that by convention vm, disks, and stemcell tests are named 
     as Test_VmOpsXX, Test_DiskOpsXX, and Test_StemcellOpsXX respectively. 

#### Running the CPI directly

##### Configuration

Create a cpi.json configuration file:

##### Run
Run it using the previously created json
```
$ echo "{\"method\": \"method_name\", \"arguments\": []}" | cpi -configFile="/path/to/cpi.json"
```
### Installing BOSH using this CPI

Refer to [Deploying BOSH Director Guide](https://github.com/oracle/bosh-oracle-cpi-release/tree/master/docs/deploy_director.md) in the [BOSH Oracle CPI release](https://github.com/oracle/bosh-oracle-cpi-release) repository.
